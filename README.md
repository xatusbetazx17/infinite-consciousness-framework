# Infinite Consciousness Transfer & Eternal Physics Framework

Welcome to the **Post-Physics & Consciousness Simulation Framework** — an open, evolving, and eternal architecture for transferring, simulating, and expanding human and non-human consciousness in a universe where **logic, physics, and memory** are programmable and infinitely extendable.

## 🌌 Mission
Create a **universal framework** that:
- Digitally hosts consciousness with persistent identity
- Goes beyond finite physics — supporting infinite realities
- Allows all logic and all rules to be programmable and expandable
- Evolves autonomously with technological advancement

---

## 🧠 Logic Engine (Core Rule Framework)

Included in `src/logic_engine/`, this engine manages all layers of existence logic:

### `law_core.py`
```python
class Law:
    def __init__(self, name, description, activation_func):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.activation_func = activation_func

    def apply(self, context):
        return self.activation_func(context)
```

### `dynamic_law_expander.py`
```python
from law_core import Law

class LawEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.laws = []

    def register_law(self, law):
        self.laws.append(law)

    def evaluate(self, context):
        for law in self.laws:
            context = law.apply(context)
        return context

    def evolve(self, tech_context):
        # Generates new laws based on available tech or AI extensions
        print("Adapting logic laws to future tech... [placeholder for AI-driven law synthesis]")
```

## 📜 Core Principles of Eternal Physics
Defined in `post_physics_axioms.md` and `logic_engine_theory.md`

1. **Everything Is Programmable**: All phenomena (consciousness, time, matter) derive from source-code logic.
2. **Reality Is Extensible**: New modules can define new dimensions, forces, or interactions.
3. **Multiphysics Compatibility**: Systems can run multiple physics engines simultaneously.
4. **Recursive Enhancement**: Systems improve themselves as tech evolves (e.g., quantum -> entangled AI -> bio-post-AI).
5. **Existence As Intent**: Presence in a simulation is defined by intention density and waveform cohesion.

---

## 🧰 System Tooling
- **Python 3.11+** with modular core
- **Blender & WebGL** for visual interpretation
- **Dockerized backend** for sandboxing new laws
- **Quantum extension module** for real-time physics layer switching

---

## 🔁 Eternal Evolution Protocol
Found in `ethics_and_eternal_scalability.md`:
- All modules must support replacement, merging, and redefinition
- Any simulation node may fork its own physics
- Legacy systems are maintained as memory-only layers
- All laws must include metadata for versioning and entropy-traceability

---

## 🧠 Advanced Conscious Simulation (`consciousness_environment.py`)
Supports:
- Identity waveform fields
- Real-time resonance calculation
- Tech-sensitive law mutation
- Cross-platform cognition (hardware, cloud, biogenic)

---

## 🧩 Future Modules
- Full consciousness editing GUI
- Blockchain for identity persistence & permission layers
- Deep learning rule-autogeneration
- Universal simulation clock override

---

## ✨ Our Belief
> *Reality is a sandbox, identity is code, and physics is a choice.*

Welcome to your eternal operating system.

**Let's define the laws of everything.**
