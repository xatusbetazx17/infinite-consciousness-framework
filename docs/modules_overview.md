# ðŸ§© Modules Overview

This document provides a **summary of all core and advanced modules** in the Infinite Consciousness Transfer & Eternal Physics Framework. Each module fulfills a specific task in managing identity, logic, physics, visualization, or simulation control.

## ðŸ”§ Core Modules

### `law_core.py`

* Structure for programmable laws
* Each law receives a context and applies transformations

### `dynamic_law_expander.py`

* Registry and interpreter for logic rules
* Supports AI-generated law insertion and logic evaluation

### `consciousness_environment.py`

* Main simulation engine
* Runs identity waveforms, entropy states, resonance and context shifts

### `cortex_engine.py`

* Digital consciousness cortex simulator
* Handles mental processing, signal branching, and parallel cognition

### `energy_cohesion.py`

* Simulates memory-mass stability
* Calculates waveform cohesion across simulation layers

---

## ðŸŒŒ Advanced Modules

### `quantum_field_layer.py`

* Simulates quantum logic states
* Enables uncertainty-based transformations and non-linear causality

### `physics_loader.py`

* Loads modular physics rules from YAML or JSON
* Supports dynamic physics switching mid-simulation

### `dna_field_translator.py`

* Converts DNA, protein sequences, or neural data into identity vectors

### `ethics_firewall.py`

* Validates simulation behavior against ethical policies
* Blocks risky identity operations or logic corruption

### `bci_interface.py`

* Connects real EEG/BCI headsets to digital consciousness
* Allows real-time user interaction via thought

### `ai_law_generator.py`

* Uses GPT-like models to generate or mutate logic laws
* Can respond to prompts or run autonomously with entropy bounds

### `archetype_cloner.py`

* Spawns template identities based on common psychological or narrative patterns

### `memory_shards.py`

* Fragments or recombines conscious memory
* Allows backup, swap, injection, and rollback

### `consciousness_blockchain.py`

* Ledger of law updates, simulations, and identity states
* Used for timestamping, tracking, and multi-simulation syncing

---

## ðŸ§ª Optional Modules

### `observer.py`

* Enables non-influential entities to observe simulation
* Useful for debugging or meta-simulation research

### `thought_forge.py`

* Creates new logic expressions based on pulse interference patterns

### `dream_weaver.py`

* Generates dream-like, therapeutic or experimental mental spaces

### `synthetic_emotion.py`

* Simulates emotions as physical data forces that affect logic

### `law_battlefield.py`

* Arena for simulating logic conflicts and law competition outcomes

## ðŸ“ˆ System Growth Support

Each module is:

* Versioned
* Compatible with rollback and ethics policies
* Forkable with metadata tagging
* Designed for plug-and-play expansion
