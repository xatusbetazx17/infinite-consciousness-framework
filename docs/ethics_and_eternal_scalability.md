# üß† Logic Engine Theory

This document explains the **underlying theory and mechanisms** that drive the Logic Engine in the **Infinite Consciousness Transfer & Eternal Physics Framework**. It is the heart of how realities are formed, laws are interpreted, and consciousness is able to navigate programmable universes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is the Logic Engine?

The Logic Engine is a dynamic interpreter that reads, applies, and evolves laws within a simulated or augmented existence. It acts as a bridge between static axioms and active simulation environments.

It consists of:

* A **Law Registry** (stored in `law_core.py`)
* A **Context Evaluator** (hosted in `dynamic_law_expander.py`)
* A **Tech-Aware Evolution Layer** (optional, AI-powered)

## üß© Law Structure Format

Every law is an object with three parts:

```python
class Law:
    def __init__(self, name, description, activation_func):
        self.name = name                # Unique law name
        self.description = description  # Summary of the rule
        self.activation_func = activation_func  # A function that transforms context
```

Laws can be written in Python or described in external formats such as YAML or JSON for interoperability.

---

## üß† Context System

A "context" is the current state of reality in a simulation. It may include:

* Identity waveform info
* Current law set
* Entropy levels
* Simulation physics engine selected

Each law **receives a context**, applies its logic, and **returns a new context**.

## üß† Example Law Function (Inverted Time Law)

```python
def reverse_time_law(context):
    if context["entropy"] < 0.3:
        context["time_flow"] *= -1
    return context
```

## ü§ñ AI-Driven Law Evolution

The Logic Engine can evolve by:

* Reading `tech_context` or simulation history
* Auto-generating new logic via GPT or `ai_law_generator.py`
* Replacing or mutating existing logic

**Prompt example:**

> Generate a logic law that alters identity mass based on emotional flux.

## üß¨ Logic Layer Types

| Layer       | Description                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Base        | Core axioms from `post_physics_axioms.md`     |
| Conditional | Reactive laws based on environmental triggers |
| Meta        | Laws that rewrite other laws dynamically      |
| Forked      | Custom user realities with self-defined laws  |

## üîß Tools That Use Logic Engine

* `physics_loader.py`: Loads YAML law files
* `archetype_cloner.py`: Applies logic blueprints to identity seeds
* `law_battlefield.py`: Simulates conflicts between opposing law sets

## üß† Philosophy

> "Law is not enforced by code. Law is intention executed in logic."

This system does not just simulate the universe ‚Äî it defines the *meaning* of existence, one law at a time.

Your laws. Your logic. Your reality.
